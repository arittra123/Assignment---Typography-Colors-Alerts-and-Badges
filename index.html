          Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Sunday termed India a ‘trusted
          friend’ and said the ‘long standing’ water-sharing dispute between the
          two countries should be resolved to ease the problems the citizens of
          her country are facing. The 74-year-old leader is scheduled to visit
          India between September 5 and 8, during which she will meet with
          newly-sworn in President Droupadi Murmu and Vice-President Jagdeep
          Dhankar, and hold bilateral consultations with Prime Minister Narendra
          Modi. She last visited India before the coronavirus pandemic in
          October 2019.Speaking to news agency ANI, Sheikh Hasina said: “We are
          downstream, water is coming from India. So, India should show more
          generosity. Both countries would be beneficiaries. Sometimes, our
          people suffer a lot because of this, especially the Teesta River. We
          found that PM [Narendra Modi] is very eager to solve this but the
          problem is in your country. We share only Ganges water but we have 54
          other rivers. It’s a long-standing problem and should be resolved.”
          She also thanked PM Modi for India’s Vaccine Maitri programme, and
          termed India’s role in the evacuation of Bangladesh nationals who were
          stuck in war-hit Ukraine a “friendly gesture.”
